# UFO SIGHTINGS WEBSITE ANALYSIS
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webpage that allows the site visitor to filter through the table data of reported UFO sightings.  In order to accomplish that task, a html website was storyboarded and designed, then the interactive portion was built using dynamic javascript coding to allow researching of database via multiple criteria.
## Results
So once the reader gets to the webpage, *"UFO Sightings: Fact or Fiction"*, you will see an opening promotional statement to read providing the context for the website. It then invites the reader to do a little research or UFO "fact" discovery. The first thing you may notice is a table of data listing details on documented UFO sightings.  If you are interested in looking at narrow or specific data criteria, then you've come to the right website.  On the left side of the table are a set of input boxes where you can do a filter search one or multiple criteria.
To do a search:
1. Place your cursor inside one or more boxes and type to enter either a Date, City, State, Country or Shape.
2. Note: Text must be exactly entered as the example exhibited in light grey type inside the filter boxes. (e.g. Enter a State: *GA* (2 letters), not Georgia)
3. Click the left-hand button on your mouse.  Only the data based on your criteria will show in the table.
4. To return to the full table of data and clear your boxes, backspace through each box to ensure input is clear and then left click on the State input box.
Following these steps will allow you to do multiple searches and to refresh your data.


## Summary
In summary, this website allows you to learn basic details about UFO sightings at varied locations. However, if the next goal is to improve the user experience of this website, then two recommendations would be warranted:
1) The filter search should use drop-down boxes with choices to select.  This way the reader doesn't have to guess what to input. Evenmoreso, the "city" filter box should be enabled after data is found for the state.  (e.g., a "shape" drop down box should allow selections for triangle, light, cylinder, sphere, disk, oval, etc.).
2) Once the data is filtered, there should be a counter displayed on how many row results have returned based on the search criteria. For example, it could be useful to know for analysis purposes whether there was 7 light shaped UFOs vs 20 cigar shaped UFO sightings in CA.  Or, in how many states did triangle-shaped UFO sightings appear?
